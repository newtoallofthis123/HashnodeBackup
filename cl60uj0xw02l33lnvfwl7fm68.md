# The Rise of API's

Okay, So one thing I had always wondered is: Do big companies like Spotify, Google and Youtube build a separate backend and a database for every platform and how do they even manage the integration. Then I came across the concept of api's. API stands for Application Programming Interface and most of the popular internet services use api's. Although not all api's a public, most are  with an api key.
## Imagining an API

This is one of the most popular representations of an api: think of the server as the kitchen and you as the customer. An API can be compared to the waiter who gets you the food, in this case information processed in the server.

So technically, all the talk of integration boils down to simple front end development integrated with an uniform and strong api which is what provides the functionality, the brain, to a website

## Qualities of a good api

A good api must have a few hallmark properties stated below
- It must be versatile: A good api must work fast anywhere and to the user's needs
- It must be fast: It must be fast and must have less downtime
- It should be secure: The api must be secure and should work with appropriate api key's.
- It should be easy to integrate: This part of the api is crucial and is very important

## Building an API
 There are many good ways to build an api, but in my opinion, the most easy and secure way is to build it in flask or fastapi. Both use [python](https://python.org) and a excellent for a beginner and a advanced programmer. Fastapi is, as the name suggests, even more faster and reliable but I am a die hard fan of flask. Many of my projects are written using flask and I am awestruck by the ease and convivence it gives. Want to try it out on your own? Given below is the code for an simple api
